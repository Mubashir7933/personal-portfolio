## Overview
This project is a **university-grade Event Management System**. It lets admins create and manage events, while students can browse, register, and receive confirmations. Built with **ASP.NET Core MVC** and **Entity Framework Core**, it follows a clean folder structure (`Controllers`, `Models`, `Views`, `Data`, `Migrations`, `wwwroot`) and uses **SQL Server** for persistence.

### Key Features
- **Event CRUD**: create, edit, publish/unpublish, delete.
- **Role-based access**: Admin vs Student flows (authorization filters).
- **Registrations & capacity**: seat limits, waitlist basics.
- **Search & filters**: by date, category, and keyword.
- **Schedules & venues**: time slots, locations, and details pages.
- **Email confirmations**: pluggable service (SMTP/provider-ready).
- **Dashboards & reports**: registrations per event, attendance exports.

### Tech Stack
- **ASP.NET Core MVC**, **C#**
- **Entity Framework Core** (Code-First Migrations)
- **SQL Server** (localdb or full)
- Frontend with **Razor Views** + Bootstrap (in `wwwroot`)

### Project Layout
- `Controllers/` â€“ MVC controllers (Events, Registrations, Admin, Auth)
- `Models/` â€“ domain models (Event, Registration, User/Roles)
- `Data/` â€“ DbContext + seeding
- `Migrations/` â€“ EF Core migrations
- `Views/` â€“ Razor pages (shared layout, partials)
- `wwwroot/` â€“ static assets (css/js/img)
- `appsettings.json` â€“ config (connection string, email settings)

### Getting Started (Local)
1. **Clone** the repo and open the solution.
2. Set your **connection string** in `appsettings.Development.json`.
3. Apply migrations:

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```
